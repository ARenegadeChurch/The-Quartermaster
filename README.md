This bot is written by one dude and ran on shitty free servers. If you have any issues, while I can and will try to fix them, it might not be immediate, nor will it be a permanent fix.

Discord API is also kinda dismal. And I'm also used to working on non-deployed code, eg. Personal projects. Again, give me time, things should work eventually.
